# Doom-Nukem

Last project of the 42's graphic branch. The goal of this project is to make a complete doom-like FPS game in C.

We choosed to use the 42's MinilibX library to create our window and render our images, because of its simplicity, great performances and lightness.

This project is available for MacOs.

---------- Setup -------------- Be sure to have an internet connection before going through this.
